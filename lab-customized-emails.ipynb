      "Imagine two dice that are connected in a special way so that when one is rolled and shows a certain number, the other one always shows the same number, no matter how far apart they are. This is similar to how quantum entanglement works in the world of tiny particles. When two particles become entangled, their properties are linked in a way that one particle's behavior instantly affects the other, even if they are far apart. It's like the dice always showing the same number, no matter where they are. Quantum entanglement is a strange and fascinating phenomenon that scientists are still trying to understand.\n"

    "GPT-3.5 performs well with specific, well-defined prompts. The more context and direction you provide, the more accurate and on-point the responses.\n",
    "When crafting prompts, focusing on key details ensures that the model includes all necessary elements in the response.\n",
    "There were no significant hallucinations or deviations from the task, but further creativity or engagement could be prompted explicitly when needed (e.g., asking GPT to be more descriptive or fun for a child).\n"
